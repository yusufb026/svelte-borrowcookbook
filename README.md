# Borrowed Cookbook

Borrowed Cookbook was originally created as a birthday gift from a boy in love to a girl who likes cooking and testing new recipes. This is her personal recipe book that will hopefully bring joy to others as well.

The entire site was powered by [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/) and a [PHP](https://www.php.net/) theme, but nowadays only the backend runs on ProcessWire and the frontend is made with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
